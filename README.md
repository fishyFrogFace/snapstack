A template project combining Snap with Stack for simpler dependency management

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Stack installed](https://www.haskell.org/downloads).

### Installing

Build the project by running

```
stack build
```

To get the server running, type

```
stack ghci
```

Then call main from inside GHCi
```
*Main Lib> main
```
The server is now running at [port 8000](http://localhost:8000)
